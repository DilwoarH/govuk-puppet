description "GOV.UK Logstream: Application Logging"

# ideally we'd use the "manual" stanza to disable job startup in
# development, but this stanza was only added in upstart 0.6.7 and
# lucid runs upstart 0.6.5.
start on runlevel [2345]
stop on runlevel [!2345]

respawn

# If the app respawns more than 5 times in 20 seconds, it has deeper problems
# and should be killed off.
respawn limit 5 20

# example:
# initctl start logstream LOG_FILE=/var/log/whitehall/upstart.err.log \
#                         TAG="whitehall UPSTART STDERR"
#
# LOG_FILE: specify the location of log file to be tailed
# TAG: should be a string of tags to tag a log line with me
instance "<%= @logfile %>"
