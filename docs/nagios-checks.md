# Nagios checks

When creating a service, it is desirable to also check that it is
functioning correctly. Our standard for monitoring is Nagios. You can
see more details of how to monitor a service with Nagios in the
[Icinga Puppet module](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/blob/master/modules/icinga/manifests/client/checks.pp).
